## Decision tree to classify english and dutch words from passage. 
For this assignment, we will be investigating the use of decision trees and boosted decision stumps to classify text as one of two languages.
Specifically, your task is to collect data and train (in several different ways) some decision stumps/trees so that when given a 15 word segment of 
text from either the English or Dutch Wikipedia, your code will state to the best of its ability which language the text is in.(Link to entire problem description: https://www.cs.rit.edu/~jro/courses/intelSys/lab2/lab2.html)
