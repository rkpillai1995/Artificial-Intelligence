 ##SWI-PROLOG
 
 Write a Prolog program to solve the problem mentioned below including all the family tree data, but skip the "m-th cousin" part.
 
Write axioms describing the predicates Grandchild, Greatgrandparent, Ancestor ,
Brother , Sister, Daughter , Son, FirstCousin, BrotherInLaw, SisterInLaw, Aunt, and
Uncle. Find out the proper definition of mth cousin n times removed, and write the definition in first-order logic. 
Now write down the basic facts depicted in the family tree in
Figure 8.7. Using a suitable logical reasoning system, TELL it all the sentences you have
written down, and ASK it who are Elizabeth’s grandchildren, Diana’s brothers-in-law, Zara’s
great-grandparents, and Eugenie’s ancestors. (Source : Artificial Intelligence
