The aim of the project is to generating optimal paths for orienteering during different seasons. In the sport (or "activity", depending on your level of fitness/competitiveness) of orienteering, you are given a map with terrain information, elevation contours, and a set or sequence of locations to visit ("controls"). There is a combination of athletic skills and planning skills required to succeed - a smarter competitor who can figure out the best way to get from point to point may beat out a more athletic competitor who makes poor choices! In this lab, you are given computer-friendly inputs so that you can use an algorithm to determine the best path for you to take depending on your ability.
